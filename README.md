## 🎯 Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze time-based trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across different countries or regions
- Visualize the data using charts and maps
- Present key findings in a well-documented report

## 💡 Insights and Reflections

- Countries have significantly different vaccination rollouts and case trends.
- Death rates often vary not only with infection levels but also with healthcare infrastructure and early intervention.
- Some countries with high vaccination rates still experience spikes in new cases, highlighting the role of variants and other factors.
- Interactive visualizations such as choropleth maps offer compelling geographical insights into the global spread and control efforts.
